# Zuma
Sequence merging software for folder directories.

Outplayed is a standalone application that automatically captures gaming moments and outputs them as files into a unique folder every session.
Unfortunately, there is no way to combine these videos effectively and efficiently.

How To Use:

Copy zuma.exe into a directory containing only video files that you wish to combine. Double click on it, it will do its magic, and will output a single video titled "combined.mp4."
