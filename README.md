Sequence merging software for folder directories.

Outplayed is a standalone application that automatically captures gaming moments and outputs them as files into a unique folder every session.
Unfortunately, there is no way to combine these videos effectively and efficiently.

The avel library has methods for the combination of multiple files. However, the library currently doesn't support filenames with whitespaces, a problem for which I cannot currently find a Universal solution.

Instead, all the files are renamed to a numeric index, and then converted.


I hope you and anyone else that comes across this script might find it useful. I will package it as an .exe in the following days.
